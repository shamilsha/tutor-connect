Database schema file:
    backend/data/tutoringdb.mv.db
backend/tutor-connect/src/main/resources/application.properties
   It has database configuration properties. Currently application uses jdbc H2 database
frontend/package-lock.json:
   Information regarding  all packages used by frontend,
frontend/src/components/LoginForm.jsx:
   Login form, it call handlesubmit when click login buttong and  it send form data to backed end port 8080 and receive respose.
   It saved user info into localStorage in client side and navigate to dashboard component.   
frontend/src/components/SignupForm.js:
   Like login form, it uses a form and send the data to backend api in port 8080. Once got the response and then it navigate to component /login.
signaling-server/server.js:
  It create a WebSocket which listen to port 8081, It also creates a Map of client list. when any client connected it call
  wss.on('connect', (ws)=>{}) method, where it set wss.on('message', ()=>{}) method, so that when any message arrive it will trigger.
  It handle different kind of message, such as 'register', 'logout' 'offer', 'answer', 'ice-candidate'. For register it send back
  registered message to the client and also broadcase to all other clients. For offer, answer and ice-candiate, it relay the data
  to the target candidate with comes with the intended  target client. For logout message, it delete the client from the client Map
  and broadcast to all other clients/peers. For ws.on('close', ()=>{})it delete the clinet from the map and broadcast updated peerlist.
  Every 30 seconds it sends a  heartbeat to all clients. If listening socket is closed, it stop sending heartbeat.

 Q: How register client works.
 A: SignupForm:
       when clicked, handleSubmit is called 
       It send a port message to port 8080 where backend service is listening.
    UserController:
       Signup request reached to signup api of UserController.java, it send the OK response back to signup form.
    SignupForm:
       It received the OK response from UserController and navigate to /login component, in App.js router is defined for /login to LoginForm component
Q: How login works:
    LoginForm:
      User fills the information, click login, which will call handleSubmit where it will send the data to backend api listening to port 8080.
    UserController:
      login request reached to login api within UserController and response Ok back to LoginForm.
    LoginForm:
      login form received the OK response from backend, and navigate to /dashboard component, 
    DashboardPage:
      In the contructor load the user info from local storage and it creates a WebRTCProvider instance by passing the user Id.
      When DashboardPage loads it creates three component, ConnectionPanel, VideoChat, ChatPanel,
    ConnectionPanel:
      In the constructor it creates a SignalingService instance, set  this instance  into WebRTCProvider by calling setSignalingService, where it sets the onMessage callback of signaling service with handleSignalingMessage methods of WebRTCProvider.
    SignalingService:
      In the constructor, it call connect, where it connect to  WebSocket which is listening on port 8081 as signaling-server,
      Once connection establish, it send the 'register' message to signaling-server,
    signaling-server:
      Received the 'register' message, add the client Id to the client map and send 'registered' message  back to signallingService.
    SignalingService:
      Received the 'registered' message,  call onMessage callback (it will actually call webrtc provider's handleSignalingMessage)  if setup.
    WebRTCProvider:
      handleSignalingMessage, it does not do anything for 'registered' message.

Q: How Connect works?
A: When connect button clicked, it calls callback function onConnect(handleConnect in Dashboard)), which is passed to ConnectionPanel from Dashboard,
   Within handleConnect, it asynchronously call connect method of webrtc, 
   WebRTCProvider::connect:
     get the target peer Id
     create RTCPeerConnection passing configuration where iceServers is defined. then in setupPeerConnectionHandlers several callbacks sets, such as
       ontrack (called when remote track is received)
       onicecandidate (called when new ice candidate received and passed this candidate to other peer using signaling-service
       oniceconnectionstatechange
       onsignalingstatechange
       ondatachannel  --> called when received data channel from remote peer,
       onconnectionstatechange
     create dataChannel using peer connection, peerConnection.createDataChannel and call setupDataChannel to setup several callbacks such as
       onopen -->  called when dataChannel established.
       onclose
       onerror
       onmessage
     if localStream available, add all available tracks within localStream to peerConnection so that [it will send to other peer]
     create offer, set setLocalDescription passing the offer and later used signaling service to send the offer to other peer,
     other peer receives the offer and handleOffer,
     handleOffer:
       if peerConnection not yet created, create peerConnection and setupPeerConnectionHandlers like above
       setRemoteDescription within peerConnection by passing offer, if localStream exist, add tracks to peerConnection,
       createAnswer and set setLocalDescription by passing answer and send the answer to other peer using signaling service which will received first by signaling-server which will pass to the targetter peer.
     handleAnswer:
       if means, offer is created by this peer and other peer receives the offer and created the answer and this peer receives the answer.
       if we are in right state, setRemoteDescription, local description already set before sending the offer,  
       if it has pending ice-candidate, add all those ice candidates to the peerConnection.
     handleIceCandidate:
       if remoteDescription is set (means offer and answer exchanged already), then addIceCandidate with peerConnection,
       if not, add addIceCandidate to pendingCandidates list, which will be added to peerConnection when remoteDescription is set,

     dataChannel.onopen is called when datachannel established, we can assume connected, video channel mayb or may not be set yet
     dataChannel.onopen:
       call onConnectionStateChange and set as connected,calls onConnectionStateChange callback method of webRTCProvider which is defined in DashboardPage,
       where it update the connection status as connected, this connectionstatus is passed as property inside ConnectionPanel, so
       when connectionstatus prop changed, it will automatically re-render the connectionPanel UI where the connectionstatus button color will be updated.
       
Q:   Screen share star then stop, remote peer does not clear the screen
A: Fix,
Success! The Fix Worked!
So the issue was indeed a combination of both problems:
React State Management Race Condition: isScreenShareActive was being set to false by another function before handleStreamChange could process the stream removal, causing the comparison false !== false = false to skip the state update.
ScreenShareWindow Component Logic: The component wasn't properly prioritizing the isVisible prop over stream existence checks.
ï¿½ï¿½ The Complete Fix:
Fix 1: DashboardPage.jsx - Forced State Update
Fix 2: ScreenShareWindow.jsx - Prioritized Visibility Logic
ðŸ“‹ What This Means:
âœ… Peer 1 stops screen share â†’ sends explicit stop message
âœ… Peer 2 receives stop signal â†’ removes stream from WebRTC
âœ… Race condition handled â†’ forced state update triggers re-render
âœ… ScreenShareWindow hides â†’ prioritizes isVisible={false} prop
âœ… Mutual exclusivity works â†’ screen share, images, and PDFs properly clear each other
ï¿½ï¿½ Key Lesson:
The issue was multi-layered - it required fixes at both the state management level (DashboardPage) and the component rendering level (ScreenShareWindow). This is why my previous single-layer fixes didn't work.
Great debugging session! The mutual exclusivity between screen sharing, images, and PDFs should now work correctly across all peers. ðŸš€
Perfect! The screen share stop issue is now resolved. The mutual exclusivity between screen sharing, images, and PDFs should work correctly across all connected peers.
